Hello!
Apple Snacks Magazine is a Wordpress Powered collective magazine created and edited by me, Kelley Kavanaugh. This github repo contains 6 iterations of Apple Snacks Magazine, the Wordpress theme. It was not created to be "out of the box" used by anyone else, but if you want to check it out, or modify it for your own use, that's okay by me. 

If you do, please:
1. Change the Apple Snacks Logo to something you own
2. Please leave my credit in the footer
3. Let me know where you've used it! I'd love to see your work. kelleykavanaugh@gmail.com

Some "features" of this theme (current version):
~ 3 column posts display on homepage, author pages, category pages
	~ This feature works because of a fixed height which means your posts cannot be longer than a set number of characters. This is acheived on Apple Snacks with the help of the Advanced Excerpt plugin: http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-excerpt/
	~ Apple Snacks is limited to 9 posts per page, a setting in your Wordpress Admin area.
~ Black backgrounded "tabs" on every post displaying that posts Category
~ "Columns" Page Template displays a list of categories used on your site
~ "Contributors" Page Template displays a list of authors registered on your site
	~ Uses the plugin User Photo: http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-photo/
	~ Has custom fields added to Users for Facebook & Twitter

Please let me know if you use my Wordpress theme, or if you need help with anything on it!

Thanks,

Kelley Kavanaugh
